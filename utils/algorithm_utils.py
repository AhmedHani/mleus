  Args:
    reference_corpus: list of lists of references for each translation. Each
        reference should be tokenized into a list of tokens.
    translation_corpus: list of translations to score. Each translation
        should be tokenized into a list of tokens.
    max_order: Maximum n-gram order to use when computing BLEU score.
    smooth: Whether or not to apply Lin et al. 2004 smoothing.

    precisions and brevity penalty.
